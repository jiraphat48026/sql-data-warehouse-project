 Script Name : Create_Gold_Views.sql
 Description :
    Creates analytical (Gold layer) views that expose business-ready
    dimensions and facts derived from the Silver layer.

    These views follow a star schema design and are optimized for
    reporting, dashboards, and BI tools.

 Objects Created :
    - gold.dim_customers : Customer dimension
    - gold.dim_products  : Product dimension
    - gold.fact_sales    : Sales fact table

 Transformations & Modeling :
    - Surrogate keys generated using ROW_NUMBER()
    - Conformed dimensions across CRM and ERP systems
    - Gender and demographic enrichment from multiple sources
    - Active product filtering (excludes discontinued products)
    - Fact-to-dimension relationships via business keys

 Source → Target :
    silver.*  →  gold.*

 Purpose :
    The Gold layer represents curated, business-friendly data that is:
      - Easy to query
      - Consistent across reports
      - Ready for analytics and visualization (Power BI, Tableau, etc.)

 Design Notes :
    - Implemented as views to ensure freshness from Silver layer
    - Follows Kimball-style dimensional modeling principles
    - Suitable for semantic and reporting layers

 Warning :
    ⚠️ Existing Gold views will be dropped and recreated during execution.
